The name of the team: "Whatever"

==============================================================================

The working hours each member commits to:
  - On Saturday:
    + 3 hours to read and search important keywords for project
    + 5 hours to work online through slack
  - On Sunday:
    + Spending all available time to finish project

==============================================================================

Check-in time for codes:
  - When one member finish a function
  - When one member has a bug they cannot fix
  - After pushing to git and checking with Sentinel

==============================================================================

The strengths:
  - Huynh Xuan Vien: creative
  - Ngo Ba Hoang Thien: open-minded, friendly, focused, hard working

The weaknesses:
  - Huynh Xuan Vien:  unclear code
  - Ngo Ba Hoang Thien: explanation skill

==============================================================================

The allocation of the workload
  - Huynh Xuan Vien: subprocess, -m, -t and some function about json for
  second mission 2
  - Ngo Ba Hoang Thien: -n and write script for main mission 2
  => Both: Searching about memory allocation, run-time performance and number
  of function calls, benchmarking function and the way to choose to optimise
  code

==============================================================================

Strategy to understand the code base:
  - Discuss the solution and the algorithms together
  - Clearly explain each member ideas
  - Agree on one coding style, solution a algorithm
  - Immediately ask for code lines we don't understand
